# AsciiLand-C
Small 'rpg' i guess where you can walk around, equip items and... well that's it. Also it's HELLA buggy but hey it's my first C project so cut me a break.  
  
 * R + F to cycle inventory
 * SPACE to equip selected item
 * ARROW KEYS to move around
 * Magenta blocks will take you to the next map, to make a new map it's as simple as making a new map and setting its name to some coordinates that the magenta 'arrows' can latch onto
 * Crappy ECS
 * Leee epic
